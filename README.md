# dotfiles

Dotfiles managed by [stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/).

Run `./install.sh` to symlink dotfiles from `~/dotfiles/` to `~/`.
The root installer runs `install.sh` inside each top-level directory that provides one.

Be aware - if you are going to use these dotfiles, make sure you change my personal settings.

eg. gitconfig is set up for my name and email.

Thanks.
